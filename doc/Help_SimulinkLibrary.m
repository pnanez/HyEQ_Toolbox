% This document describes the Simulink-based hybrid
% equation simulator from the Hybrid Equations Toolbox, including an introduction
% to the primary components. 
% For documentation regarding cyber-physical components, see 
% <matlab:hybrid.internal.openHelp('CPS_Components') here>. A list of examples are
% available <matlab:hybrid.internal.openHelp('TOC_examples') here>. For a
% description of the internal workings of Hybrid System blocks, see
% <matlab:hybrid.internal.openHelp('Help_integrator_system') The Integrator System>.

%% Primary Components
% The HyEQ Toolbox includes four main Simulink library blocks that allow for
% simulation of hybrid systems:
% 
% * $\mathcal{H}$ *defined with external functions*. For this block, the data of
% the system $(C, f, D, g)$ are defined as MATLAB functions in plain-text |.m|
% files. This block does not support systems with inputs.
% * $\mathcal{H}$ *defined with external functions and inputs*. 
% This block is the same as the prior one, except that it has inputs.
% * $\mathcal{H}$ *defined with embedded functions*. For this block, the data of
% the system $(C, f, D, g)$ are defined as embedded functions that can only be
% edited within Simulink. This block does not support systems with inputs. 
% * $\mathcal{H}$ *defined with embedded functions and inputs*. This block is the
% same as the prior one, except that it has inputs.
% 
% The following image shows these blocks in the Simulink Library Browser.

% 
% Next, we see inside the Simulink blocks for simulating 
% a hybrid system $\mathcal{H}$ with inputs implemented with using _embedded
% MATLAB function blocks_.

% <img src="images/HSinput.png"  style='width: 100%; max-height: 472px; object-fit: contain'>
% </html>
% 
% In this implementation, four blocks are used to define the _data_ 
% of the hybrid system $\mathcal{H}$:
%
% * The flow map is implemented in the embedded function block |flow map f|. 
% Its input is a vector with components defining the state of the system $x$,
% and the input $u$. Its output is the value of the flow map $f$ which is
% connected to the  input of an integrator. 
% * The flow set is implemented in the embedded function block |flow set C|. Its
% input is a vector with components $x^-$ and 
% input $u$ of the _Integrator system_.  
% Its output is equal to $1$ if the state belongs to the set $C$ or equal to $0$ otherwise.
% The minus notation denotes the previous value of the variables (before integration). 
% The value $x^-$ is obtained from the state port of the integrator.
% * The jump map is implemented in the embedded function block |jump map g|. Its
% input is a vector with components $x^-$ and 
% input $u$ of the _Integrator system_.  
% Its output is the value of the jump map $g$.
% * The jump set is implemented in the embedded function block |jump set D|. Its
% input is a vector with components $x^-$ and 
% input $u$ of the _Integrator system_.  
% Its output is equal to $1$ if the state belongs to $D$ or equal to $0$ otherwise.

%% Deciding Whether to Use Embedded or External Functions
% Prior to v3.0, only hybrid systems with embedded function blocks could be used
% to model systems with inputs, but now external functions can be used for
% systems with inputs as well. 
% Thus, embedded vs. external functions are interchangable in terms of the types
% of systems they can model. 
% There are other benefits and limitations to each, however.
% 
% External functions have the benefits that the functions are stored
% in plaintext |.m| files, so they can be easily tracked with source control
% managagment software, such as Git. They can also be resused without
% modification when using the HyEQ MATLAB library. 
% 
% Embedded functions, on the other hand, result in the
% entire Simulink model being self-contained in a single file. 
% Simulations may also
% be somewhat faster and can be compiled and deployed to embedded
% systems. The code used in an embedded function is restricted to 
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/matlab-language-features-supported-for-code-generation.html

%% How to Use a Hybrid System Block
% To add a Hybrid System to a Simulink model:
% 
% # Open the Simulink Library Browser and select "Hybrid Equations Toolbox"
% from the list of toolboxs and drag the desired block into your model.
% # Double-click on the Hybrid System block to open a dialog box. Fill each
% field with either your desired value or a variable that you define in the
% initialization script.
% # Define the functions for $f$, $g$, $C$, and $D$ for the hybrid system. 
% The process for specifying the functions are different for
% embedded vs. external functions, so we describe each approach below.
% # Connect the intputs and outputs as desired. For Hybrid System blocks with inputs, there
% are two state outputs $x$ and $x^-$. Most of the time, you should use the $x$
% output, as it is the current state of the Hybrid Subsystem block. Sometimes,
% however, when you have a closed loop system, Simulink warns of an "<https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/algebraic-loops.html Alegbraic
% Loop>" error. This means that there is a dependency loop that must be resolved.
% To fix it, switch from using the $x$ output to the $x^-$ output somewhere in
% the loop (changing a single connection is sufficient). The $x^-$ output is delayed by one
% integration step behind $x$, thereby breaking the dependency loop.
% # When a HyEQ block is added to a Simulink model, several things are changed in
% the model. In particular, solver settings are changed such that the relative
% tolerance is a variable named |RelTol|, the maximum step is |MaxStep|, and the
% simulation stop time is |T|. You must define |RelTol|, |MaxStep|, and |T|
% prior to running the Simulink model (e.g., in an initialization script, as
% described below).
% 
% *How to define $f$, $g$, $C$, and $D$ in hybrid systems with external
% functions*. 
% To specify $f$, $g$, $C$, and $D$ for a hybrid system with external functions
% block, create four MATLAB function files (.m extensions) that are either on
% the MATLAB path or in the working directory from which you will run the
% Simulink model. (Using
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html
% packages> can help prevent name conflicts.) 
% Then, enter the name of each function preceded by an @ sign in the
% corresponding field in the mask dialog.
% For example, if the flow map function
% is placed in a function file name |f.m|, then the Flow Map field in the mask
% dialog should contain |"@f"| (without quotation marks). 
% 
% As an alternative to creating function files, you can write 
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html 
% anonymous functions>, such as
% 
%    @(x, u, parameters) parameters.A*x + parameters.B*u
% 
% directly into any of the _function handle_ fields in the mask dialog. 
%  
% *How to define $f$, $g$, $C$, and $D$ in hybrid systems with embedded
% functions*. 
% To specify $f$, $g$, $C$, and $D$ for a Hybrid System with Embedded Functions
% block, "Look inside" the block mask by either 
% clicking the down arrow in the lower-left corner or selecting "Mask" > "Look
% Under Mask" from the context menu. Double-click on each MATLAB Function block
% to edit the respective functions. 
% (There's nothing "magic" about the MATLAB function blocks. 
% If desired, these blocks can be replaced with any other Simulink blocks that
% have the correct input and output dimensions.)

%% Writing Functions for $f$, $g$, $C$, and $D$
% Regardless of whether you are using a Hybrid System block with embedded or
% external functions, the definitions of $f$, $g$, $C$, and $D$ follow the same form. 
% When creating a system without inputs, each function must take two input
% arguments: the state "x" and parameters object "parameters". (The "parameters"
% argument is described later.)
% When creating a system with inputs, each function must, instead, have three input
% arguments: the state "x", the input "u", and a parameter object "parameters". 
% 
% For both systems with and without inputs, each function must have a single output argument.
% For |f| and |g|, the output is a column vector that matches the size of "x".
% For |C| and |D|, the output is scalar that takes values in 
% $\{\texttt{0}, \texttt{1}\}$.
% 
% Thus, example function signatures for systems without inputs are as follow:
% 
%   function xdot = f(x, parameters)
%   function inC = C(x, parameters)
%   function xplus = g(x, parameters)
%   function inD = D(x, parameters)
% 
% For systems with inputs, the following function signatures can be used:
% 
%   function xdot = f(x, u, parameters)
%   function inC = C(x, u, parameters)
%   function xplus = g(x, u, parameters)
%   function inD = D(x, u, parameters)
% 
% The names of the functions and arguments can be modified when using external
% functions, but for embedded functions the input arguments must match those
% given above (unless the names of the data signals are renamed in the *Ports
% and Data Manager*).

%% Defining Function Parameters
% Often, in addition to the state
% and input, the values return by |f|, |g|, |C|, and |D| will depend on some constants. 
% For example, the flow map of the bouncing ball depends on the rate of
% acceleration due to gravity. One could simply define 
% 
%    g = -9.8;
% 
% within the
% function, but this is bad practice. What will you do, for instance, if you
% want to sometimes simulate a 
% bouncing ball on the Moon instead, where gravity is weaker? 
% You would need to modify the function each
% time you change |g|. To avoid this, a |parameters| object, defined
% by the user, is given as the last input argument for each function. The |parameters| 
% object can be any type of MATLAB object (e.g., an array or object), but the recommended
% approach is to use a |<matlab:doc('struct') struct>| because it allows new
% parameters to be added easily and makes the code easy to read. 
% In an initialization script, a |parameters| struct can be
% created as follows: 
% 
%   parameters = struct();
%   parameters.A = [0, 1; 0, 0];
%   parameters.B = [0; 1];
%   parameters.optimizer = 'BFGS'; % Nonnumeric values are OK.
% 
% The |parameters| struct is passed to a hybrid system block by entering the name of the variable in the
% "Parameters" field of the mask dialog.
% 
% Then, within |f|, |g|, |C|, and |D|, parameters are accessed via the
% last input argument, as shown below. 
% 
%   function xdot = f(x, u, parameters)
%       % Flow map
%       A = parameters.A;
%       B = parameters.B;
%       xdot = A*x + B*u;
%   end
% 
% The last input argument |parameters| must be present (even if it is unused).
% For embedded functions, its name must be "parameters" 
% (MATLAB may suggest replacing it with "~" if it is unused, but this will cause an error). 
% 
% *WARNING:* The |parameters| object should be constant while simulating a hybrid system. 
% Modifying |parameters| within |f|, |g|, etc., 
% could produce unpredictable behavior because the hybrid
% solver sometimes backtracks in time (e.g., when searching for the time
% when a jump occurs). Therefore, all values that change during a solution must
% be included in the state vector |x|.

%% Variable Initialization
% Before a Simulink model is run, all variables referenced in block parameters
% or the model configuration parameters must be defined in the MATLAB
% workspace. This can be done by entering the variables one-by-one in the MATLAB
% command window, but for the sake of quickly, easily, and accurately reproducing 
% results, it is best to put the variable definitions into an initialization
% script. In this documentation we refer to the initialzation script as
% |initialize.m|.
% 
% Within |initialize.m|, it is typically necessary to define the following:
% 
% * Initial conditions (e.g., |x0|, |z0|, etc.)
% * Parameter objects, as described above
% * The maximum flow time |T|
% * The maximum number of jumps |J|
% * The relative error tolerance |RelTol|
% * The maximum integration step size |MaxStep|.
% 
% The following initialization script is used for the
% <matlab:hybrid.internal.openHelp('Example_1_2') bouncing ball model>.
% 
% <include>src/Matlab2tex_1_2/initialize.m</include>
% 
% We define the values of |RelTol| and |MaxStep| because the default integration
% settings do not always produce simulations with the 
% desired accuracy or speed.
% See
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/odeset.html#namevaluepairarguments
% odeset> for a description of |RelTol|, |MaxStep|, and other solver settings.
% These parameters can have significant effects on the speed and accuracy of solutions.
% To modify other solver settings, open
% |Modeling>Model Settings>Solver|.
% 
% The name |T| should be used for the maximum flow time because the simulation
% stop time is automatically set to |T| whenever a HyEQ block is added to a
% model. Other variables names, however, such as |x0|, |J|, and |parameters|,
% can be changed on a block-by-block basis so
% long as the names are consistent between the fields in the block mask dialogs
% and in the initialization script.  
% 
% After initialization, the simulation is run by clicking the run button 
% or selecting |Simulation>Start|.


%% Postprocessing and Plotting solutions
% Similarly to the initialization script, a postprocessing script, which we will call |postprocess.m|, here,
% is used to generate plots of solutions after the simulation is run.  
% Below is an example of |postprocess.m| for the bouncing ball example. 
% The functions used to generate the plots are described in
% <matlab:hybrid.internal.openHelp('HybridPlotBuilder_demo') 
%   Creating plots with HybridPlotBuilder>.
% 
% <include>src/Matlab2tex_1_2/postprocess.m</include>

%% Automatically Running Initialization and Postprocessing Scripts
% The scripts |initialize.m| and |postprocess.m|, described above, can be run
% manually in the MATLAB editor or command window, but to run them automatically
% use _model callbacks_. To setup model callbacks, open the Simulink
% Library Browser and navigate to Hybrid Equations Toolbox > Other.
% 
% <html> 
% <img src="images/set_callback_blocks.png"  style='width: 100%; max-height: 140px; object-fit: contain'> 
% </html>
% 
% Then, drag the "Set Initialization
% Script" and "Set Post-Processing Script" blocks to your model and double
% click on them. A file selection dialog will open that allows you
% to select a MATLAB .m script file to use in the callback. After a callback
% script is set, the "Set Initialization
% Script" and "Set Post-Processing Script" blocks can be deleted from your model.
% 
% To define model callbacks manually or remove existing callbacks:
% 
% # open the "Modeling" tab in Simulink
% # open the "Modeling Setup" menu
% # open "Model Properties" 
% # open the "Callbacks" tab. 
% 
% Use the |InitFcn| callback to specify
% code to run before the Simulink model starts and |StopFcn| to specify code to
% run after the model finishes. Typically, the |InitFcn| callback contains
% code that calls an initialization script, such as
% 
%   initialize;
% 
% and the |StopFcn| callback calls a post-processing script, such as
% 
%   postprocess;
%
