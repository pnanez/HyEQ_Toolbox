%% Continuous Time (CT) Dynamics
%
% The block containing the Continuous Time (CT) Dynamics is shown here:
% 
% <<images/CTdynamics.png>>
% 
% It defines the CT dynamics by assembling the 
% time derivative of the state $[t\ j\ x^\top]^\top$. 
% States $t$ and $j$ are considered states of the system because 
% they need to be updated throughout the simulation in order to 
% keep track of the time and number of jumps. Without $t$ and $j$, 
% solutions could not be plotted accurately.
% This is given by
% 
% $$
% \left[\begin{array}{c}
% \dot{t} \\ \dot{j} \\ \dot{x} 
% \end{array}\right]
% = 
% \left[\begin{array}{c}
% 1 \\ 
% 0 \\
% f(x, u)
% \end{array}\right].
% $$
% 
% Note that input port $1$ takes the value of $f(x,u)$ through the output of the
% _Embedded MATLAB function block f_.
%% Jump Logic
% The inputs to the jump logic block, shown below, are the output of the blocks _C_ and _D_
% indicating whether the state is in those sets or not, 
% and a random signal with uniform distribution in $[0,1]$. 
% 
% <html> 
% <img src="images/JumpLogic.png" style='width: 100%; max-height: 250px; object-fit: contain'> 
% </html>
% 
% The variable _rule_ defines whether the simulator gives priority to jumps, 
% priority to flows, or no priority. It is initialized in |initialize.m|.
% 
% The output of the Jump Logic is equal to |1|, triggering a jump, when:
%
% * the output of the _D block_ is equal to one and |rule=1|,
% * the output of the _C block_ is equal to zero, 
%       the output of the _D block_ is equal to one, and |rule=2|,
% * the output of the _C block_ is equal to zero, 
%       the output of the _D block_ is equal to one, and |rule=3|,
% * or the output of the _C block_ is equal to one, 
%       the output of the _D block_ is equal to one, |rule = 3|, 
%       and the random signal $r$ is larger or equal than $0.5$.
% 
% Under these events, the output of this block, which is connected to the integrator external 
% reset input, triggers a reset of the integrator, that is, a jump of $\mathcal{H}$. 
% The reset or jump is activated since the configuration of the reset input is set 
% to "level hold", which executes resets when this external input is equal to one 
% (if the next input remains set to one, multiple resets would be triggered). 
% Otherwise, the output is equal to zero.
% 
%% Update Logic
% 
% The _Update Logic_ block is shown here:
% 
% <html> 
% <img src="images/UpdateLogic.png"  style='width: 100%; max-height: 200px; object-fit: contain'> 
% </html>
% 
% The update logic uses the _state port_ information of the integrator. 
% This port reports the value of the state of the integrator, $[t\ j\ x^\top]^\top$, 
% at the exact instant that the reset condition becomes true. 
% Notice that $x^-$ differs from $x$ since at a jump, 
% $x^-$ indicates the value of the state that triggers the jump, 
% but it is never assigned as the output of the integrator. 
% In other words, $x \in D$ is checked using $x^-$ and if true, 
% $x$ is reset to $g(x^-,u)$. Notice, however, that $u$ is the same because at a jump, 
% $u$ indicates the next evaluated value of the input, 
% and it is assigned as the output of the integrator. 
% The flow time $t$ is kept constant at jumps and $j$ is incremented by one. 
% More precisely,
% 
% $$
% \left[\begin{array}{c}
%   t^+ \\ j^+ \\ x^+ 
% \end{array}\right]
% = 
% \left[\begin{array}{c}
%   t^- \\ 
%   j^{-}+1 \\ 
%   g(x^-,u)
% \end{array}\right]
% $$
% 
% where $[t^-\ j^-\ {x^-}^\top]^\top$ is the state that triggers the jump. 

%% Stop Logic
% 
% The _Stop Logic_ block is shown here:
% 
% <html> 
% <img src="images/StopLogic.png"  style='width: 100%; max-height: 250px; object-fit: contain'> 
% </html>
% 
% It stops the simulation under any of the
% following events:
%
% * The flow time is larger than or equal to the maximum flow time specified by $T$.
% * The jump time is larger than or equal to the maximum number of jumps specified by $J$.
% * The state of the hybrid system $x$ is neither in $C$ nor in $D$.
% 
% Under any of these events, the output of the logic operator
% connected to the _Stop block_ becomes one, stopping the simulation.
% Note that the inputs $C$ and $D$ are routed from the output of the blocks 
% computing whether the state is in $C$ or $D$ and use the value of $x^-$.
