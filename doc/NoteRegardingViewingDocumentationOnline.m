%% 00 - Note Regarding Reading HyEQ Toolbox Documentation Online
% 
% The HyEQ Toolbox documentation is only designed to be read within MATLAB Help. 
% Most of the links will not work when viewed online, such on the Mathworks File
% Exchange website. In particular, links between
% documentation files and links to particular Toolbox files (e.g., example
% files) will not work because MATLAB commands are used to resolve the links.
