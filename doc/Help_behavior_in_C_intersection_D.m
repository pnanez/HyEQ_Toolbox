%% Mathematical Model
% Consider the hybrid system with data
% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}
% f(x) := x & C:= [1, 3] \cup [5, 9] \\ \\
% g(x) := \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
%                       \mathrm{round}(x+1) & \textrm{if } x \leq 6 \\ 
%                       0 & \textrm{if } x = 7
% \end{array}\right. & D:= \{0\}\cup [2, 6] \cup \{7\}.
% \end{array}$$
% 
% The sets $C$ and $D$ are visualized here:
%
% $$\begin{array}{cccccccccccc} 
%    C: &   & [ &   & ] &   & [ &   &   &   & ]
% \\ D: & * &   & [ &   &   &   & ] & * &   & 
% \\ \hline
%    x: &     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9
% \end{array}$$
% 
% Solutions to this model are not unique because solutions are allowed to
% both flow or jump everywhere in $[2, 3) \cup [5, 6] \cup \{7\}.$ (Note that
% despite $3$ being in $C\cap D$, it is not possible to flow because the
% trajectory would immediately leave $C$.) 

% The unconventional placement of "\\" at the start the new lines instead of the
% the end of the previous line is a workaround to ensure that the equations are
% rendered correctly on GitHub.

%% Priority Rules for Intersection of C and D
% When solving hybrid systems, the HyEQ Toolbox only computes a single solution,
% so we must specify which of the various possible solutions are computed. 
% This is done is by defining a variable |rule| in the MATLAB workspace. The
% value of |rule| specifies whether flows or jumps have priority in $C \cap D$. 
% 
% * If |rule = 1|, jumps have priority.
% * If |rule = 2|, flows have priority.
% * If |rule = 3|, then flowing and jumping is randomly selected at each time step.
% 
% The following simulations show the use of the variable |rule| priority of
% flowing vs jumping when computing solutions inside $C\cap D$. 

%% Jump Priority (|rule = 1|) 
% When |rule=1|, jumps have priorty, so anytime a (numerical) solution $x$ is in $C\cap D$,
% then $x$ will jump. For the model presented above, this effectively restricts
% $C$ as shown here:
% 
% $$\begin{array}{rccccccccccc}
%  C \textrm{ (effective)}: &   & [ & ) &   &   &   & ( &\circ&   & ]
% \\ D:                     & * &   & [ &   &   &   & ] &  *  &   &  
% \\ \hline
%  x:                       & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 &  7  & 8 & 9
% \end{array}$$
%  
% The following plot shows a solution from $x0=0$ with jump priority (|rule=1|).
% The solution always jumps except when 
% $x$ is in $[1, 2) \subset C \setminus D$.

%% Flow Priority (|rule = 2|) 
% When |rule=2|, flows have priorty, so anytime a solution $x$ is in $C\cap D$,
% then $x$ will flow unless $x$ is on the boundary of $C$ and $f(x)$ points out
% of $C$. For the model presented above, this effectively restricts
% $C$ as shown here:
% 
% $$\begin{array}{rccccccccccc}
%    C:                       &   & [ &   & ] &   & [ &   &   &   & ] 
% \\ D \textrm{ (effective)}: & * &   &   & ( &   & ) &   &   &   &

%    x:                       & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9
% \end{array}$$
%  
% The following plot shows a solution from $x0=0$ with flow priority (|rule=2|).
% The solution only jumps when $x$ is in $\{0\} \cup (3, 4) = D \setminus C$.
% At the end of the solution, $x$ leaves $C \cup D$ and terminates.

%%
% Note that the stopping logic is implemented such that when the
% state of the hybrid system is not in $(C \cup D)$, then the
% simulation is stopped. In particular, if this condition becomes true
% while flowing, then the last value of the computed solution will not
% belong to $C$.

%% Random Priority (|rule = 3|)
% When |rule=3|, then at each time step that a solution $x$ is in $C \cap D,$
% there is 50% chance of jumping and 50% chance of flowing.
% 
% For the model presented above, the intersection of $C$ and $D$ is illustrated
% here. Within the intersection, either flowing or jumping can occur in
% numerical solutions.
% 
% $$\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
% C \cap D: &   &   & [ & ] &   & [ & ] & * &   &
% \\ \hline
% x:        & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9
% \end{array}$$
% 
% A solution computed with |rule=3| is shown below. The first
% interval of flow ends around $t=0.7$, shortly after the solution enters
% $[2,3]$. Because there is a 50-50 chance of jumping at each time step, jumps
% tend to happen very quickly when a solution enters an interval in $C \cap D$.
% The solution then jumps several times in $D \setminus C$ until 
% $x = 7 \in C\cap D$. The first time this happens, the solution happens to
% jump, reseting $x$ to $0$, but the second time it happens to flow, causing it
% to leave $D$ and eventually leave $C$ as well. 

% 
% This simulation also reveals that this implementation does not
% precisely generate hybrid arcs. The maximum step size was set to |0.1
% e-3|. The solution flows during the first two steps of the integration
% of the flows with maximum step size. The value at |t=0.1e-3| is very
% close to |1|. At |t=0.2e-3|, instead of assuming a value given by the
% flow map, the value of the solution is about |0.5|, which is the
% result of the jump occurring at |(0.2e-3,0)|. This is the value stored
% in $x$ at such time by the integrator. Note that the value of |x| at
% |(0.2e-3,0)| is the one given by the flow map that triggers the jump,
% and if available for recording, it should be stored in |(0.2e-3,0)|.
% This is a limitation of the current implementation.

%% Numerical Limitations
% Isolated points in $D$ that are also in $C$, such as $x=7$, require
% extra care. If a solution starts at |x0=6.1|, then it will almost
% certainly flow pass $7 \in D$ without jumping (even if |rule=1|)
% because the odds of the numerical value of |x| ever being exactly $7$ is
% minuscule. Thus, from a numerical standpoint, |x| never enters $D$. 
% Isolated points in $D$ on the boundary of $C$ require similar care, 
% as the solution is likely to terminate rather than enter the jump set.

% Run the initialization script.
hybrid.examples.behavior_in_C_intersection_D.initialize

x0 = 6.2; % Must be strictly between 6 and 7.

% Furthermore, suppose the jump map given above is modified by removing the
% $\mathrm{round}$ function, as shown here
% 
% $$
% g(x) := \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
%                       x+1 & \textrm{if } x \leq 6 \\ 
%                       0 & \textrm{if } x = 7.
% \end{array}\right. $$
% 
% For a solution from |x0=1| with jump priority |rule=1|, one might expect that
% a solution will flow until $x = 2\in D,$ jump several times until $x=7\in D$
% and reset to $x=0$. This will not happen, however, because the numerical
% solver cannot determine the exact position of $x$ when it enters $D$ at $x=2$,
% so the solution flows slightly past $2$, say, to $2.0001$. Then, after several
% jumps, $x$ is at $7.0001 \not\in D$, at which point it flows until it leaves
% $C.$ Therefore, one must be careful in the design of $C$ and $D$ to ensure
% that numerical calculations do not create undesired behavior.
